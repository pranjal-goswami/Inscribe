<p style="text-align: center;">There are days when it feels sick, all of it <br />There are days when you do not know who you are<br />and the misty crystal surface reflects that familiar stranger <br />waving by <br />She turns away for there are days that intimidate you <br />beyond your wildest dreams<br />a breakdown for I don't know her,I can't see her for shes lost<br />the days when every step and every word you utter is an effort<br />I look at her as she tries to appear strong and answer their questions<br />I search her eyes for a hint of a tear or two<br />but shes heck good at this...<br />like the gloomy skies resisting thunder<br />Deep Inside she knows every question they raise makes her shiver more<br />yet defiantly she maintains the indifference.<br />Surrounded by the hues of her own darkness<br />shes Lost..</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">an empathy for her muse's dejection enveloping her soul <br />and now she knows<br />that his claws that clenched her can contain her no more<br />the demon was slowly loosing that hold..<br />'yes' she says,there are days when I loose my faith in everything I see and everything thats me<br />yet I turn towards 'thee'<br />for thou as my shepherd we rise together<br />a pocket full of sunshine, the Knights armor and might<br />Sila's conviction and Solomon's mines<br />everything that is you and now 'I'<br />I walk in faith<br />for miracles do exist and paths are made"<br />for she might fail a ten thousand times<br />yet the 'illumination' of that 'bulb' shinning too bright <br />is worth a strike..</p>
